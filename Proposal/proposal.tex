\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Distributed ledger technology creates issues
Reasoning about the behaviour of blockchain ...


% Smart contracts create issues
The advent of smart contracts (programs that run on the blockchain itself) gave
rise to another source of vulnerabilities. Since these (possibly Turing-complete)
programs often deal with transactions of significant funds,
it is of utmost importance that one can reason and ideally provide formal proofs
about their behaviour in a concurrent/distributed setting.

% Aim of thesis
\paragraph{Research Question}
The aim of this thesis is to provide a mechanized formal model of ...,
in which one can begin to formally investigate the expressiveness
of the extended UTxo model.
Moreover, ... compare with account-based ... Ethereum ...

Put concisely, the research question posed is:
\begin{displayquote}
	\textit{How much expressiveness do we gain by extending the UTxO model?} \\
	\textit{Is it as expressive as the account-based model used in Ethereum?}
\end{displayquote}

\paragraph{Overview}
Section~\ref{sec:background} will review some basic definitions related to blockchain
technology and introduce important literature, which will be the main subject of study
throughout the development of our reasoning framework.

Section~\ref{sec:results}

\subsection{Proof Mechanization}
Through mechanization ...
... vs informal mathematics ...

It is exactly this side effect, that will allow us
to discover edge cases and increase the confidence
of the model under investigation.

As our proof development vehicle, we choose Agda\todocite ...

\subsection{Agda}

... stay on a highly abstract level ... postulate cryptographic operations etc ...

\paragraph{Limitation}
... proof automation ala Coq ...



\subsection{The IOHK approach}

... rigorous methodology ...
... industry co-existing with academia ...
... formal verification (Agda/Coq) -> prototype/reference implementation (Haskell) -> production codebase (Haskell) ...

\subsection{Functional first}

... UTxO vs Account ...
... functional vs imperative ...
... dataflow vs ?? ...
